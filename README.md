# HueMidiController

A simple program that uses MIDI input to do some fancy things with Phillips Hue lights.

Just to note: lots of things including the bridge IP, device ID, and chord triggers are hardcoded.
To run locally, you would need to create your own device ID with your Hue Bridge, as well as determine the IDs of your lights.
